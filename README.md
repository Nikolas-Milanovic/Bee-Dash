# Bee-Rush
This is my grade 12 computer science culminative project, which I achived a 100% on! 

The game is designed with object-oriented programming and graphical user interface. It's played by dragging the bees to the hive without them colliding.

To play the game, download the BeeRush.jar file. Your computer might not open the file as it may be read as an unidentified developer. In that case, you can go to your security & privacy settings to allow access to the jar file.

* NOTE: THE DOWLOADABLE JAR FILE HAS ONLY BEEN COMPILED FOR MAC OS. Also this game uses mouse events significnatly (such as mousepressed and mousedragged), therefore is may run slowly if theres not enought cpu power

**How To Play:**

Once you open the game you'll see the home screen. Click PLAY if your ready or TUTORIAL for instrucions.

The game has begun! Help the bees rebuild their hive. Click anywhere on the bee and drag it to its home (the hive).
Beware the bees can only be dragged so fast. To reset the bee's path, click the bee again.

Lead the bees towards the black & yellow beehive to rank up points and advance your level.

As the levels progress, difficulty is inhanced by increasing the number of bees and the bee hive starts to move! Notice how the hive is in a different location.

But, make sure the bees don't collide or else...SPLAT! Once the game is done, you can exit or play again.
