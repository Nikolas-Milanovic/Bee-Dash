# Bee-Rush
This is my grade 12 computer science culminative project, which I achived a 100% on! 

The game is designed with object-oriented programming and graphical user interface. It's played by dragging the bees to the hive without them colliding.

To play the game, download the BeeRush.jar file. Your computer might not open the file as it may be read as an unidentified developer. In that case, you can go to your security & privacy settings to allow access to the jar file.

* NOTE: THE DOWLOADABLE JAR FILE HAS ONLY BEEN COMPILED FOR MAC OS. Also this game uses mouse events significnatly (such as mousepressed and mousedragged), therefore is may run slowly if theres not enought cpu power

How To Play:

Once you open the game you'll see the home screen. Click play now if your ready or click the right button for instrucions. 


The game has begun! Help the bees rebuild their hive. Click anywhere on the bee and drag it to its home(the hive).
Beware the bees can only be dragged so fast. To reset the bee's path, click the bee again.



Lead the bees towards the black & yellow beehive to rank up points




But, make sure the bees don't collide or else...SPLAT! 



Once the game is done, you can exit or play again :)
